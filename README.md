### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


**Enanamy/Enanamy** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on...ummmmm...**ddl**
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to survive the _exam week_
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on LOL
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting out of the pool.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about ... nothing
- ğŸ“« There is actually no need for you guys to reach me :)
